# APECtyper GUI

Simple graphical user interface (GUI) for running **APECtyper.sh (APEC Finder)** without using the terminal.

This tool is a **Python-based wrapper** that facilitates the execution of APECtyper by providing a minimal graphical interface.  
It does **not** implement any genotyping or analysis logic itself.

This tool allows users to:
- Select a FASTA file
- Select an output directory
- Run APECtyper with a single click

Designed for Linux/macOS systems.

## Dependency / External Tool

This GUI depends on **APECtyper (APEC Finder)** and requires the original `APECtyper.sh` script to be installed separately.

All analyses and results are produced by **APEC Finder**.  
This repository only provides a graphical interface to simplify its execution.

**Please cite the original APEC Finder / APECtyper publication when using this tool in academic or diagnostic work.**
